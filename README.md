# Motivation
I'll be working with the Reviews and Listing data from Airbnb for [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) and [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) sites downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to try to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most common themes in guest reviews, and how do they correlate with review scores?
2. What are the seasonal patterns in listing prices and availability in Seattle and Boston?
3. How much are Airbnb homes earning in certain time frames and areas?

Positive reviews might highlight cleanliness, responsiveness, or convenience, while negative reviews might mention noise or poor communication. Price, amenities, location, and host responsiveness might significantly impact review scores. Prices and demand increase during peak tourist seasons or significant events.

This analysis uses the [Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) and [Boston Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) datasets provided on Kaggle. These datasets were contributed by Airbnb and include detailed information about listings, reviews, and calendar data. I would like to thank the contributors and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) for making these datasets publicly available, which made this project possible.
